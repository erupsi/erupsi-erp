To get started with development, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you've become a collaborator for this repository. If you haven't become a collaborator for this repo and want to contribute, see [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute-) section below.
2. Make sure you have Node.js, Docker Desktop/Engine with Docker Compose, and your chosen API client installed.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine (choose HTTPS or SSH):
   * **HTTPS** (recommended for most users):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/erupsi/erupsi-erp.git
     cd erupsi-erp
     ```
   * **SSH** (if you have set up SSH keys with GitHub):
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:erupsi/erupsi-erp.git
     cd erupsi-erp
     ```
4. Install current dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're on the root of the project
   npm install
   ```
5. Checkout to a new branch by following our [branching and commit guideline](#branching--commits-).
6. Setup your service directory by following the [project structure](#project-structure-) above.
7. Code and document your changes while following our [coding guidelines](#coding-guidelines-).
8. [Test and lint](#testing--linting-) your code.
9. Commit your changes by following our [branching and commit guideline](#branching--commits-).
10. Once you're done making changes, open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/erupsi/erupsi-erp/pulls).

## Coding Guidelines üõ†

To ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the project, please follow these guidelines when
contributing:

### General Guidelines üìú

* Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting. See the `.eslintrc.json` files to learn about the rules used for this project and the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/) docs.
* Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) utility classes for styling in React components.
* Keep services modular and loosely coupled. One service focuses on doing good at its job.
* Use environment variables for configuration (`.env`) and **DO NOT** commit it. You may use either project-level or service-level env file, or both.
* Document API endpoints in each service's `openapi.yaml`.
* Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and components (`startTime`, `employeeId`, etc).
* Follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions.
* Create unit tests for each service you've created. Ensure you get a minimum of 80% test coverage, higher is better.

### Branching & Commits üîÄ

* Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes:
  * Branch names should be descriptive, e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/inventory-update`.
* Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard if applicable:
  * Use `feat:` for new features.
  * Use `fix:` for bug fixes.
  * Use `docs:` for documentation changes.
  * Use `style:` for changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.).
  * Use `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
  * Use `test:` for adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.

### Installing Dependencies üì¶

* All service `package.json` belong to **root** `package.json` as npm workspaces. All package.json share a single `package-lock.json` file.
* Do all package operations at the project's root.
* If you need to do package operations only for your service, specify your package name by using `--workspace=<package_name>` option.
* To install dependencies at the project's root:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
* To install **new** dependencies at the project root:
  ```bash
  npm install package1 package2...
  ```
* To install new **development** dependencies at the project root:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev package1 package2
  ```
* To initialize a new `package.json` in your service and add it to the npm workspace:
  ```bash
  # Example for npm init for auth-service located in src/backend/auth-service
  npm init --workspace=src/backend/auth-service
  ```
* To install new dependencies specific for your service:
  ```bash
  # Example for installing deps in auth-service
  npm install --workspace=auth-service package1 package2
  ```

### Testing & Linting üß™

* Each service should have its own tests under `__test__`.
* Make sure all tests pass and there are no lint errors before pushing:
  ```bash
  # Run unit test for all workspaces
  npm run test --workspaces
  # Run unit test for your service only (e.g. auth-service)
  npm run test --workspace=auth-service
  # Check all linting
  npm run lint
  # Check ESLint linting
  npm run lint:es
  # Check markdown linting
  npm run lint:md
  ```
* Fix all fixable linting errors:
  ```bash
  # Fix all linting
  npm run lint:fix
  # Fix ESLint linting
  npm run lint:fix-es
  # Fix markdown linting
  npm run lint:fix-md

  # Recheck again until all linting errors are resolved
  npm run lint
  ```
* Ensure your tests cover at least 80% of your code:
  ```bash
  $ npm test

  > erupsi-erd@1.0.0 test
  > jest

   PASS  src/backend/user-service/__tests__/sum.test.js

  ```

### Building Docker Container üêã

* Make sure your service have a `Dockerfile`. You can copy it from another service and change the paths inside it. Our Dockerfile template should be sufficient for your need:
  ```Dockerfile
  # Make sure to point docker context to the monorepo root when building this Dockerfile.

  # Stage 1: Builder
  FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

  # Set working directory
  WORKDIR /app

  # Copy the entire monorepo (minimized with .dockerignore)
  COPY ../../.. .

  # Install only dependencies for this workspace
  RUN npm install --workspace=src/backend/<your-service-dir> --production

  # Stage 2: Copy only the built node_modules and source to a clean runtime image
  FROM node:20-alpine AS runtime

  WORKDIR /app

  # Copy installed node_modules from builder stage
  COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
  COPY --from=builder /app/src/backend/<your-service-dir> .

  # Set Node.js environment (optional)
  ENV NODE_ENV=production

  # Set default command
  CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]

  ```
* Make sure you've already copied the `.dockerignore` file from another service as well.
* Ensure Docker Engine in your machine is running.
* Build your container and tag it as "auth-service:latest":
  ```bash
  # Example for building auth-service container
  docker build -f src/backend/auth-service/Dockerfile -t auth-service:latest .
  ```
* Run your container and expose it at port 3000:
  ```bash
  # --rm option will automatically deletes the container upon the container have been stopped
  docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 auth-service
  ```
* See all running containers in your machine:
  ```bash
  $ docker ps
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                         NAMES
  4008ad2fe50c   auth-service   "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   27 seconds ago   Up 26 seconds   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp, [::]:3000->3000/tcp   nifty_burnell
  ```
* Stop your service's container:
  ```bash
  # The container name is nifty_burnell as seen in the docker ps output
  docker stop nifty_burnell
  ```

### Running All Containers as a Whole üåê

* Make sure you've already add your service (and db if needed) in the `compose.yaml` file at the project's root. Here's our template that should fit most situation:
  ```yaml
  # === Your Service Name ===
  <your-service-name>:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: src/backend/<your-service-name>/Dockerfile
    container_name: erupsi-<your-service-name>
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3001:3000" # Expose port 3000 of the service on host port 3001
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@<your-service-name>-db:5432/${POSTGRES_<YOUR_SERVICE_NAME>_DB}
    depends_on:
      - <your-service-name>-db
    networks:
      - erupsi-erp-network
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.<your-service-name>.rule=Host(`erupsi.docker.localhost`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.<your-service-name>.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.<your-service-name>.tls=true"

  <your-service-name>-db:
    image: postgres:17
    container_name: erupsi-<your-service-name>-db
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - <your-service-name>_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - erupsi-erp-network
  ```
* Run all containers in background using Docker Compose:
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```
* Stop all running containers:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
